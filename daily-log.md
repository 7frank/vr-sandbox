## 26.02.

* bundle demo and let ppl create content
and get some input of what they want to create next
meanwhile have a donate option or patroen to see how monetization would go

* e-mail: rb-tv with above idea and see if there could be a format created that tracks the progress similar to beanscastle
    * kliemansland-vr
    * rb-land
* override body.world.gravity => proxy o Ã¤ to fetch region gravity vector
    * we'll need local-physics per region otherwise server-side authorative physics seems troublesome

## stack


* create some interactable demo components like:
    * jump pad
    * vehicle
