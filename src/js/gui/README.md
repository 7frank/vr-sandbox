#gui related thoughts

we'll need some gui and below is a list of potential candidates. a window manager, list-views and other complex widgets are a definitive plus.
Also a recent and frequent development.

## babylon gui

* how to integrate?
* potential to port the DynamicTexture part?
* nice set of widgets
* bad performance of demo in firefox
    * http://www.babylonjs.com/demos/gui/
* sbs support where as other implementations might need optimisations so not every draw call is triggered twice

## windstorm gui
<img src="http://www.zephyrosanemos.com/images/GUI/384/GUIExternal.png" height="300"  />

* http://www.zephyrosanemos.com/#heading1
* does have a nice implementation with window manager
* code base unclear, where is what, license?
* (in addition does have a nice terrain renderer)
    

## infamous
* https://github.com/trusktr/infamous/
* interesting but not much to see
* interoperability of html and web-gl 
* seems not to have potential for side-by-side
